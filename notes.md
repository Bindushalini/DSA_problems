stacks: LIFO
similar to list, cannot use list as any user can alter by appending, remove the data directly.
Create stack ds using list and class of our own
push,pop,top, isempty - operations
applications: evaluating arithmetic expression, syntax parsing, recursion, undo redo in word processors.


2D lists: list containing other lists
inner list can be different types of data
maze as 2D list
cartesian coordinates vs matrix coordinates
Every Python module has it’s __name__ defined and if this is ‘__main__’, it implies that the module is being run standalone by the user and we can do corresponding appropriate actions.

Depth frst search - finds the path of current node and until it reaches a dead end continues. Once dead end is reached, goes back to nearest available path to explore and finds

**Advantages**: optimizations for criteria(cost, speed, safety, fuel etc.)
path finding
scheduling algorithms
determining the order of compilation tasks for software builds
